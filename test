Dear Vernon Downs:

I am applying to your IT Specialist position.
I have not worked in a year, due to medical issues.
I have been recently cleared for work.

Most recently, I was a Unix Systems Engineer at IPsoft, Inc. of New York NY, where I work closely with major clients to monitor their IT infrastructure needs. I closely monitored client systems, and developed automated solutions in response to their unique requirement. My experience is complimented by a Ph.D. in Physics and certifications from Red Hat and Cisco.

My dissertation was in computational biophysics, so I am very proficient with programming. I have a lot of experience using Python, with scipy and numpy. I was very active as a teacher programming, www.github.com/jphafner/physicsAMC, at Baltimore City Schools and Masters for two years.

My achievements can be attributed to my ability to respond effectively to constantly changing in fast-moving, often hectic environments. Iâ€™m known as a polished communicator and motivated professional, and I strike to continuously deliver beyond expectations.

I encourage you to read further about my background in the accompanying resume. I welcome an interview with you and look forward to what I anticipate will be the first of many positive communications. Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Jeffrey Hafner
