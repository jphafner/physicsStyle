They say you should hire based on Intelligence, Integrity, and Energy.
I have a PhD in Physics, I have intelligence.
I have whistle blown on a previous employer, so I have integrity.
I will leave energy to you.

I most recently worked at IPsoft, where I was described as highly innovative on my 2017 Performance Review.

I am a Red Hat Certified System Administrator, RHCSA.
I am a Cisco Certified Entry Networking Technician, CCENT.
