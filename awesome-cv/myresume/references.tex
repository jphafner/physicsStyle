%    {\bfseries Overall:}
%Jeffrey,
%
%I know working 3rd shift presents a great challenge in keeping in touch with the vibe and camaraderie of the rest of the team, but you've handled it well.
%You have done an admirable job working with the BLR team and Keith given the challenges; especially that this is your first real job in the field.
%Your communication efforts with McKesson in particular are commendable.
%
%%For the year ahead, I think you know what the primary area of improvement needs to be: Ticket Handling.
%%Remember: Response times are important, but so are resolution times and diligent follow-up.
%%You cannot let tickets linger for weeks or longer in your queue.
%%Push to close them ASAP relevant to priority and provide periodic updates so the client knows issues are not being ignored.
%%Additionally, please ensure to keep your station tidy.
%%These are shared spaces so everyone is expected to clean up after themselves.
%
%%I see 2018 as a year of tremendous opportunity for you here.
%%The minutia of your job requirements should not hold you back from excelling in a purely technical role.
%%Correct those issues promptly then put in the effort to increase your technical expertise.
%%Add in initiative to create more automation and create value for our clients and you will be on the fast track to a TL or TE role, or beyond.
%%Here's looking forward to accelerated growth and evolving in the year ahead!
