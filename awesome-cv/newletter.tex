\begin{cvletter}


    {\bfseries Customer Satisfaction:} One drop for McKesson and 4 Merits overall in 2017. 
    Not perfect, but not bad at all. 
    Always aim to keep our clients happy and go that extra mile.

    {\bfseries Innovation:} You've put in significant effort into creating and optimizing automation. 
    Fantastic! 
    It shows great initiative that exceeds most of the rest of your teammates'.

    {\bfseries Overall:}
Jeffrey,

I know working 3rd shift presents a great challenge in keeping in touch with the vibe and camaraderie of the rest of the team, but you've handled it well.
You have done an admirable job working with the BLR team and Keith given the challenges; especially that this is your first real job in the field.
Your communication efforts with McKesson in particular are commendable.

For the year ahead, I think you know what the primary area of improvement needs to be: Ticket Handling.
Remember: Response times are important, but so are resolution times and diligent follow-up.
You cannot let tickets linger for weeks or longer in your queue.
Push to close them ASAP relevant to priority and provide periodic updates so the client knows issues are not being ignored.
Additionally, please ensure to keep your station tidy.
These are shared spaces so everyone is expected to clean up after themselves.

I see 2018 as a year of tremendous opportunity for you here.
The minutia of your job requirements should not hold you back from excelling in a purely technical role.
Correct those issues promptly then put in the effort to increase your technical expertise.
Add in initiative to create more automation and create value for our clients and you will be on the fast track to a TL or TE role, or beyond.
Here's looking forward to accelerated growth and evolving in the year ahead!
---Brian
