    \opening{Dear Penn State University:}

    I was most recently a ROC Engineer for Tech Mahindra in Leetsdale, PA.
    I operated the robots in walmart using ROS software and docker images.
    But unfortunately they removed the position, so I am looking for new employment.
    
 I was a Unix Systems Engineer at IPsoft, Inc. of New York NY,
        where I work closely with major clients to monitor their IT infrastructure needs.
    I was reviewed on my 2017 performance review as highly innovative.
    I closely monitored client systems, and developed automated solutions in response to their unique requirement.
    My experience is complimented by a Ph.D. in Physics and certifications from Red Hat and Cisco.

%I have passed the P and FM SOA exams, so I am familiar with the math involved.
My dissertation was in computational biophysics, so I am very proficient with programming.
    I have a lot of experience using Python, with scipy and numpy.
    I was very active as a teacher programming, \url{www.github.com/jphafner/physicsAMC},
        at Baltimore City Schools and Masters for two years.
    %For an example lesson plan, and template lab report, please look here
    %    \url{www.github.com/jphafner/physicsReport}.

%I have five years of experience as a Systems Engineer, three as a volunteer during my doctorate, and two at IPsoft.
    %I have five years of experience with C, and ten with Python.
    %I have experience with OpenLDAP, Kerberos, OpenAFS during my doctorate.
    %I have create \hyperref[www.github.com/jphafner/physicsAMC]{physicsAMC}
    %I have created 

My achievements can be attributed to my ability to respond effectively to constantly-changing in fast-moving, often hectic environments. 
    I'm known as a polished communicator and motivated professional, and I strike to continuously deliver beyond expectations.


I encourage you to read further about my background in the accompanying resume. 
    I welcome an interview with you and look forward to what I anticipate will be the first of many positive communications. 
    Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.

%% Closing remarks
    %I can begin in March of next year, due to having a brain tumor, and appointments with the \href{https://www.dana-farber.org}{Dana-Farber Cancer Institute}.
    %This is also why I have not worked in a while.

%I can use Fred Parker and Ray Halbritter as references.

\closing{Sincerely:}
